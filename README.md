## Description

This project implements a class that replicates the functionality of the 'Undo' command. This class will be used by a 'Main' class, which will allow users to input options via the console.

The 'Undo' class must store the last entered commands. It should allow adding or removing commands, as well as listing the last entered commands (similar to the 'history' command in Linux).

Crucially, the 'Undo' class must implement the Singleton design pattern.
